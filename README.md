# Handwritten Digit Recognition System
The Handwritten Digit Recognition System is a project that utilizes a neural network to detect and classify scanned images of handwritten digits. This system is implemented using the MNIST dataset, which is a popular benchmark dataset for image classification tasks.

# Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of a large collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). It is divided into a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train the neural network model, while the test set is used to evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data.

# Project Overview
The project follows the following steps:
Data Preparation: The MNIST dataset is loaded and preprocessed. The pixel values are scaled and reshaped to match the input format required by the neural network.
Model Architecture: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used as the model architecture. It consists of convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for downsampling, and fully connected layers for classification.
Model Training: The model is compiled with suitable optimizer and loss functions. The training data is used to train the model, and the validation data is used for monitoring the training progress and preventing overfitting.
Model Evaluation: After training, the model is evaluated on the test data to measure its performance. The accuracy metric is used to assess the classification accuracy of the model.
Results Visualization: Various visualizations are provided to understand the model's performance. These include accuracy plots, a confusion matrix to show the classification results, and sample images with their predicted labels.
